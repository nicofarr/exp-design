\subsection{Cognitive Neurosciences and Engineering}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Cognitive Neurosciences and Engineering}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> Cognitive neurosciences is the scientific field that is concerned with the study of the biological processes and aspects that underlie cognition, with a specific focus on the neural connections in the brain which are involved in mental processes.
\item <2-> It addresses the questions of how cognitive activities are affected or controlled by neural circuits in the brain.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What is experimental design?}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What is experimental design?}
\begin{itemize}
\item<1-> An experimental design is a planned experiment set up to test the validity of a hypothesis.
\item <2-> An experimental design is a way to carefully plan experiments in advance.

% \section{What is an experiment?}
% \begin{frame}
% \frametitle{What is an experiment?}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item<1-> An experiment is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a hypothesis.
% \item <2-> Experiments provide insight into cause-and-effect by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated.
% \item <3-> Experiments vary greatly in their goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results.
% \item <4-> There also exists natural experimental studies.
% \item <5-> In an experiment, an independent variable (the cause) is manipulated and the dependent variable (the effect) is measured; any extraneous variables are controlled.
% \item <6-> An experiment is a type of research method in which you manipulate one or more independent variables and measure their effect on one or more dependent variables.
% \item <7-> The goal of an experiment is to determine whether the independent variable causes a change in the dependent variable.
% \end{itemize}
% \end{frame}

% \section{What is a control group?}
% \begin{frame}
% \frametitle{What is a control group?}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item<1-> A control group is a group separated from the rest of the experiment such that the independent variable being tested cannot influence the results.
% \item <2-> This isolates the independent variable's effects on the experiment and can help rule out alternative explanations of the experimental results.
% \item <3-> A control group can be identified by:
% \item <4-> \begin{itemize}
% \item <4-> Placebo effect
% \item <5-> Hawthorne effect
% \item <6-> Experimenter's bias
